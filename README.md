Unity3D-on-Wine
===============

Scripts for making Unity3D run on Wine.

This page is new. But new, I mean **really** new. So don't expect flashy documentation, fixed bugs or real-time support.

These scripts are in full development, and sometimes they may not work as intended.

Although they are not ready for, hmph, production use, you are free to test them.

Do that actually. It's the second best thing you can do to help.

Who knows? Maybe you'll end up with a working Unity like this:
